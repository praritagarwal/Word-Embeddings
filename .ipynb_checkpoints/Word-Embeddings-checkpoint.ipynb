    "In this exercise you will download a dataset, split it, create a tf.data.Dataset to load it and preprocess it efficiently, then build and train a binary classification model containing an Embedding layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - a. Download the [Large Movie Review Dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/), which contains 50,000 movies reviews from the Internet Movie Database. The data is organized in two directories, train and test, each containing a pos subdirectory with 12,500 positive reviews and a neg subdirectory with 12,500 negative reviews. Each review is stored in a separate text file. There are other files and folders (including preprocessed bag-of-words), but we will ignore them in this exercise.\n",
    "  \n",
    "    \n",
    "  - b. Split the test set into a validation set (15,000) and a test set (10,000).\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - c. Use tf.data to create an efficient dataset for each set.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - d. Create a binary classification model, using a TextVectorization layer to preprocess each review. If the TextVectorization layer is not yet available (or if you like a challenge), try to create your own custom preprocessing layer: you can use the functions in the tf.strings package, for example lower() to make everything lowercase, regex_replace() to replace punctuation with spaces, and split() to split words on spaces. You should use a lookup table to output word indices, which must be prepared in the adapt() method.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - e. Add an Embedding layer and compute the mean embedding for each review, multiplied by the square root of the number of words (see Chapter 16). This rescaled mean embedding can then be passed to the rest of your model.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - f. Train the model and see what accuracy you get. Try to optimize your pipelines to make training as fast as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  - g. Use TFDS to load the same dataset more easily: tfds.load(\"imdb_reviews\")."

    "We now try three different ways of removing punctuations from a tensorflow string and compare their timings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) punc_filter_and_to_lower1: use tf.strings.unicode_decode() to convert all the characters in the string into an array of their ascii codes. We then loop through this array, skipping over the places where the entry matches the ascii code of a punctuation. Finally we call tf.strings.unicode_encode() on this array to convert the ascii codes back to characters, thereby obtaining a string with all the punctuations stripped. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) punc_filter_and_to_lower2: use tf.regex_replace() to search and replace each punctuation by empty space. Pay special attention to prepend backslash in order to be able to use meta-characters in regex_replace.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3) punc_filter_and_to_lower3: simply extract the python string using its .numpy() method. Then simple iterate through the characters of the string, skipping over the punctutations. Join the resulting list of character using .join() method. \n",
    "\n",
    "4) punc_filter_and_to_lower4: Use [tfds.features.text.Tokenizer()](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/api_docs/python/tfds/features/text/Tokenizer) by setting it's \"alphanum_only\" arg to True. This way it will only parse alpha-numeric characters in the text and to split the text at occurrances of non-alphanumeric characters. Since whitespace is a non-alpha-numeric character, the output will largely consist of a list of words in the text.  The caeat with this approach is that words with apostrophe in them such as \" don't \" will be split into two words: \"don\" and \"t\". Also, [tfds.features.text.Tokenizer()](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/api_docs/python/tfds/features/text/Tokenizer) does NOT consider underscores as non-alpha-numeric, so underscores do not get removed form the text. On the other hand since, the tokenizer already generates a list of words, we use this list to generate a vocobulary of words in the dataset at this step it-self, making the preprocessing faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "There timing on the first review in the training set was as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) punc_filter_and_to_lower1: Wall time: ~ 3 s\n",
    "\n",
    "2) punc_filter_and_to_lower2: Wall time: ~ 8 ms\n",

    "3) punc_filter_and_to_lower3: Wall time: ~ 6 ms\n",

    "\n",
    "5) 4) punc_filter_and_to_lower4: Wall time: ~ 7 ms (when also udating a vocabulary of words) \n",

I still don't know why they wanted to kill the President or how the mole got involved. The villains were nameless and undeveloped, so you never felt involved in their plot. Michael Douglas and Kiefer Sutherland did their best to inject some reality into the story - the chase and confrontation were good. But Kim Basinger and Eva Longoria were both unbelievable in their roles, Basinger totally lacked character and no way could Longoria have been a Secret Service agent. This could have been a very good film but somehow it missed the way, with too many unanswered questions. Disappointing on the whole despite some very good scenes.

      "(<tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=string, numpy=b'Having just recently re-viewed \"Lipstick\" for the first time in a few decades, I backed it with \"Descent\" even though I have heard more negative comments than good from other film friends with tastes as varied as mine.<br /><br />It\\'s interesting to contrast how the unique niche of the Rape Revenge movie has evolved in the past 32 years, from the full-on gore of \"I Spit On Your Grave,\" to the tawdry sensationalism of \"Lipstick,\" to the tasteful handling of the issue in \"The Accused.\" But \"Descent,\" though making some important points, never really offers us anything truly new in terms of revelatory meaning. No, \"Descent\" is so poorly made in terms of picture and sound quality that it detracts from any significant message it could hope to make --- a message that, when examined closely, isn\\'t that groundbreaking.<br /><br />I pretty much knew the plot going in. What I wanted to see *was* the \"descent\" or degeneration of Dawson\\'s character. Being a big fan of Rosario\\'s, I was anxious to see the layers being stripped away and her psyche being slowly twisted...you know, the kind of portrayal DeNiro brings to \"Taxi Driver.\" Unfortunately, the script and the director/writer\\'s choices don\\'t provide any sort of believable transition.<br /><br />The biggest point of failure is the second act. It became obvious what the filmmaker\\'s intentions were for this segment of club-hopping, drug use, and obsession with big black stallion Adrian (every white boy\\'s nightmare, natch) from a Q&A on the DVD, but this excursion into Dawson\\'s character is never believably rendered. We don\\'t know exactly what the hell she\\'s doing half the time, what she\\'s after, or why she\\'s doing it. The poor quality of the audio/video again don\\'t help, but the sequence is just too damn long and pointless. It destroys any momentum and investment in the lead character set up during the otherwise exceptionally well-done first act. By the time we get to the finale, our interest has already waned.<br /><br />One point of success that Dawson does point out in the Q&A is that by the end \"revenge\" scene we are pumped for retribution, then realize just how drawn-out and ugly the reality is. While that\\'s certainly valid, it doesn\\'t make the scene any more intriguing.<br /><br />If you have the DVD, check out the deleted \"classroom\" scene. This is an excellent 8 minute plus outtake that crackles with energy and provocation (though all verbal) and really DOES show Dawson\\'s slow crack-up materializing as she delightfully vivisects poor Francie Swift\\'s prissy, condescending dorm counselor. If more expository scenes like this had been added and more of the middle third cut down, we might have an interesting psychological study of the impact of senseless acts of violence.<br /><br />As the film stands in the final cut, though, all we get is what we\\'ve seen before, only in a more graphic rendering.

In the process of trying too hard, they over acted and made a horrible movie. I was disappointed since I felt all the actors had made respectable choices in the past so this one couldn't be that far off the mark--but, I was wrong. I was hoping they would give out a survey at the end of the movie so I could tell them not to release this movie. I was lured in by the free aspect of the preview, but it turned out to be a waste of my time--and, usually, I'm very easily amused. It tried to be innovative and creative with the shots, ideas and filming, but because they threw together so many ideas at once, it failed. I'm not usually picky about movies and I usually don't feel the need to display my opinions about movies, but I had to warn everyone not to watch it.

      "(<tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=string, numpy=b\"I like Dylan Moran from his work in Black Books, although I found some of his stand-up to be really indulgent in terms of long confused gaps... however I was intrigued to see this film starring he and Michael Caine and curiosity got the better of me.<br /><br />I was stunned.<br /><br />Dylan's vocal range and characterisation of the different people he was playing in the film was absolutely perfect, something beyond the skills of a mere stand-up comedian and really truly on a par with alec guinness, john hurt and the other greats- truly he was skilled in his portrayal.<br /><br />Michael Caine was a very convincing prima donna and the standard british film device of having a precocious child on hand to be overly wise and withering worked- the only aspect I didn't really like was the unbelieveable plot feature of the chemistry between Dolores and the cockney gangsta's hard man played by Dylan.<br /><br />Other than that, it was great.<br /><br />I also like the non-cop-out ending where it did end up happily ever after, but with MC getting a beating. OK, it's not exactly being strung up by your goolies and beijng disembowelled (which is what a real crime boss would do to you if you nicked \\xc2\\xa350k off them) but it showed at least a small measure of reality in the story.<br /><br />I liked the film, and I would recommend it to anyone- but- I would also warn them not to turn it off after 15 minutes because it started a bit slow. If you stick it out, then it will all come back.<br /><br />And with regards to the swearing- well, they're in Ireland.

The exact same as what happened in the first film happens here again. The exact same. Only they wanted younger kids to be able see it (this accounts for the repeated presence of Bugs Bunny but why they threw in one 'f*ck' is beyond me).<br /><br />They didn't even bother to change Jackie Mason's character from Dangerfield's. Let me explain, in CADDYSHACK Rodney Dangerfield played a boorish Real Estate owner who enrages the uptight members of Bushwood country club. In this movie Jackie Mason plays a boorish Real Estate owner who enrages the uptight members of Bushwood country club. A big effort they made to change the content of the script huh? No, I don't think so. A very unfunny Dan Aykroyd shamefully copies Bill Murray's character. He even goes after the gopher (now more like a Gremlin) in much the same fashion as Murray did. <br /><br />There is not a laugh to be had. A sample of the 'comedy' in this film: Jackie Mason is getting ready for a hot date with Dyan Cannon. He is in the bathroom is his robe. He moves to the door to get dressed in his bedroom when\\xc2\\x85the door handle breaks off. Wow!?! That's the best they can do. Eight years to think of a completely new sequel and that's all we get!?! I could have pulled a better script out of my ass.<br /><br />See it only if you're a die-hard fan of the original.

And the white dude who tried to act black got VERY, VERY tiresome after way too much exposure in the picture. He weighed down a fairly good performance by the Rock, the only secondary character who you couldn't wait to see leave the screen. Bad, dumb plot.

      "(<tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=string, numpy=b'The only pure life, is one that ends with a signature in blood.<br /><br />So says Mishima anyway, a young sheltered boy who becomes a celebrity author. The life of one of Japans most celebrated literary voices, is told from three perspectives, his life just before he and four members of his private army take over a Japanese military base and commit ritual suicide(shown in color), flashbacks(shown in black and white), and scenes from his novels(shown in a kind of dreamy Technicolor set design somewhere between traditional Noh Theater and \"the Wizard Of Oz\". These stories are often told at the same time, but are edited to reinforce, the slow fusing of Mishima\\'s life with his fictions, until the end(or the beginning) when like the ancient samurai he so admires, he will be at a balance of pen and sword (when his words and actions are the same, and he is a full and \"pure\" being).<br /><br />Paul Schrader wrote the screen play for \"Taxi Driver\", and directed \"Cat People\"(a bizarre erotic horror film, which left strange impressions on me as a boy), and in Mishima, he comes closest to making a really excellent film.<br /><br />Whats interesting is to watch the poet, the homosexual, the shy and awkward man with a low body image who overstates his Tuberculosis to get of of WW2 (of which he seems forever ashamed), become a body building, samurai obsessed, a-sexual, media phenomena, all the while still writing prolific amounts of novels, plays, and short stories.<br /><br />A short and sweet version is to say Mishima has no father, and becomes obsessed with masculinity, beauty, sex and self destruction, in some tragic attempt to feel connected to something bigger than himself, that he was always missing. Watching him with his fellow suicidal cadets, you see him happy, delivering his big paternal speech, giving orders, and loving the control...until the speech itself, the point where pen and sword meet? Of course, this ignores the subtlety of the story telling craft here which makes this transformation so natural and remarkable. <br /><br />Though the story, fascinating at times, really isn\\'t this movies greatest success. The cinematography, performances, editing,music(by Philip Glass), and set designs, are really what make this worth seeing, and more than a traditional bio-pic.<br /><br />One day I will pick, up a Mishima book, he does seem to have an ear for prose, and for staging ideas, but for now I\\'m satisfied with the film.<br /><br />Those interested in Japanese Literature, and post-war culture, should check out.

      "(<tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=string, numpy=b\"The martial arts movies got huge in the 60's in parts of Asia but with the growing popularity of the infamous Shaw Brothers films, America was bound to catch on. This movie was the first to be presented in America under the Warner Bros. label and it did in fact start a craze here that flooded the 70's with martial arts films. Many of the films to follow would pale in comparison but some were great and many like Enter The Dragon (which came out shortly after this one) became huge success stories and made superstars out of these fighters.<br /><br />Fast forward almost 40 years later and this movie still holds up. Most Shaw brothers films are as good today as they were back then and truth be told no films have been made in this genre to compete with those made by The Shaw Bros back in the day.<br /><br />I like to think Martial arts are like porn and nobody watches porn for the plot just the action, well same goes with M.A. films and most of them are just a bunch of great fights with little story, this one is an exception. It doesn't have an amazing story but there is one there.<br /><br />The main guy played by Lo Lieh actually stands out amongst karate film heroes. He never brags and he never fights just because he can, he is often seen as weak and less of a fighter than most, but when he must fight, he is damn well the greatest alive. I really loved this character. Many of the bad guys were memorable and the fight scenes were just presented so amazingly. Even a small role with Bolo Yeung can be seen as the huge Mongolian, and Bolo is in my top 5 as greatest martial artist film stars ever, he was also in the above mentioned Enter The Dragon.<br /><br />The production as I've said over and over is wonderful, you can't beat the Shaws, the direction was something unlike I have seen much in films of the 70's, the use of color was well placed and made this movie stand alone and rise above the others. When the light shines on Chi Hao's hands as he does the Iron Fist, its pure beauty.<br /><br />The music was superb as well. Martial arts films were to Asia what westerns were to Italy, two separate art forms with so much in common. The countries making these films had all genres but the Japanese films were what was making waves there as the spaghetti westerns were in Italy. With their many differences the styles of these two genres were neck and neck. As seen in movies like 5 Fingers Of Death, the fights were easily compared to Sergia Leoni cowboy stand offs, and the music tied the genres together so well. The music here borrowed a little from Ironside, but it was still very original.<br /><br />Many films were inspired by this one and when I watch it I can see everything from The Master Killer to Bloodsport having been influenced. The most obvious movie to have been influenced was Kill Bill, which to me is the greatest of all time. Many of the sets Quentin used are complete replicas of ones seen here and he used the music from this film, even though the music he used was the music borrowed from Ironside. And the fight scene at the end of Kill Bill vol. 1 with The Bride and O-Ren is at times exact in comparison to the fight with Chi Hao and the Japanese thug at the end of this movie.<br /><br />I have seen many martial arts films, a few even better, but this is a MUST-SEE for fans of the genre. You can't go wrong here. The movie starts off slow but 15-20 minutes into it it picks up and doesn't slow down.\">, <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=int64, numpy=1>)\n",
