    "In this exercise you will download a dataset, split it, create a tf.data.Dataset to load it and preprocess it efficiently, then build and train a binary classification model containing an Embedding layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - a. Download the [Large Movie Review Dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/), which contains 50,000 movies reviews from the Internet Movie Database. The data is organized in two directories, train and test, each containing a pos subdirectory with 12,500 positive reviews and a neg subdirectory with 12,500 negative reviews. Each review is stored in a separate text file. There are other files and folders (including preprocessed bag-of-words), but we will ignore them in this exercise.\n",
    "  \n",
    "    \n",
    "  - b. Split the test set into a validation set (15,000) and a test set (10,000).\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - c. Use tf.data to create an efficient dataset for each set.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - d. Create a binary classification model, using a TextVectorization layer to preprocess each review. If the TextVectorization layer is not yet available (or if you like a challenge), try to create your own custom preprocessing layer: you can use the functions in the tf.strings package, for example lower() to make everything lowercase, regex_replace() to replace punctuation with spaces, and split() to split words on spaces. You should use a lookup table to output word indices, which must be prepared in the adapt() method.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - e. Add an Embedding layer and compute the mean embedding for each review, multiplied by the square root of the number of words (see Chapter 16). This rescaled mean embedding can then be passed to the rest of your model.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - f. Train the model and see what accuracy you get. Try to optimize your pipelines to make training as fast as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  - g. Use TFDS to load the same dataset more easily: tfds.load(\"imdb_reviews\")."

For example: the \"name should scream don't watch. 'How she move.' Since when can movie titles ignore grammar?\" <br /><br />There is nothing inherently incorrect about Caribbean English grammar. It's just not Canadian standard English grammar. Comments about the dialogue seem off to me. I put on the subtitles because I'm a Canadian standard English speaker, so I just AUTOMATICALLY assumed that I would have trouble understanding all of it. It wasn't all that difficult and it gave a distinctly different flavour as the other step movies I have seen were so American.<br /><br />I loved that this movie was set in Toronto and, in fact, wish it was even more clearly set there. I loved that the heroine was so atypically cast. I enjoyed the stepping routines. I liked the driven Mum character. I felt that many of the issues in the movie were addressed more subtly than is characteristic of dance movies.<br /><br />In summary, if you tend to like dance movies, then this is a decent one. If you have superiority issues about the grammar of the English standard you grew up speaking, your narrow mind may have difficulty enjoying this movie.\n"
