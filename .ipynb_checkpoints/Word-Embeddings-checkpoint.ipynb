    "In this exercise you will download a dataset, split it, create a tf.data.Dataset to load it and preprocess it efficiently, then build and train a binary classification model containing an Embedding layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - a. Download the [Large Movie Review Dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/), which contains 50,000 movies reviews from the Internet Movie Database. The data is organized in two directories, train and test, each containing a pos subdirectory with 12,500 positive reviews and a neg subdirectory with 12,500 negative reviews. Each review is stored in a separate text file. There are other files and folders (including preprocessed bag-of-words), but we will ignore them in this exercise.\n",
    "  \n",
    "    \n",
    "  - b. Split the test set into a validation set (15,000) and a test set (10,000).\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - c. Use tf.data to create an efficient dataset for each set.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - d. Create a binary classification model, using a TextVectorization layer to preprocess each review. If the TextVectorization layer is not yet available (or if you like a challenge), try to create your own custom preprocessing layer: you can use the functions in the tf.strings package, for example lower() to make everything lowercase, regex_replace() to replace punctuation with spaces, and split() to split words on spaces. You should use a lookup table to output word indices, which must be prepared in the adapt() method.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - e. Add an Embedding layer and compute the mean embedding for each review, multiplied by the square root of the number of words (see Chapter 16). This rescaled mean embedding can then be passed to the rest of your model.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - f. Train the model and see what accuracy you get. Try to optimize your pipelines to make training as fast as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  - g. Use TFDS to load the same dataset more easily: tfds.load(\"imdb_reviews\")."

    "We now try three different ways of removing punctuations from a tensorflow string and compare their timings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) punc_filter_and_to_lower1: use tf.strings.unicode_decode() to convert all the characters in the string into an array of their ascii codes. We then loop through this array, skipping over the places where the entry matches the ascii code of a punctuation. Finally we call tf.strings.unicode_encode() on this array to convert the ascii codes back to characters, thereby obtaining a string with all the punctuations stripped. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) punc_filter_and_to_lower2: use tf.regex_replace() to search and replace each punctuation by empty space. Pay special attention to prepend backslash in order to be able to use meta-characters in regex_replace.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3) punc_filter_and_to_lower3: simply extract the python string using its .numpy() method. Then simple iterate through the characters of the string, skipping over the punctutations. Join the resulting list of character using .join() method. \n",
    "\n",
    "4) punc_filter_and_to_lower4: Use [tfds.features.text.Tokenizer()](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/api_docs/python/tfds/features/text/Tokenizer) by setting it's \"alphanum_only\" arg to True. This way it will only parse alpha-numeric characters in the text and to split the text at occurrances of non-alphanumeric characters. Since whitespace is a non-alpha-numeric character, the output will largely consist of a list of words in the text.  The caeat with this approach is that words with apostrophe in them such as \" don't \" will be split into two words: \"don\" and \"t\". Also, [tfds.features.text.Tokenizer()](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/api_docs/python/tfds/features/text/Tokenizer) does NOT consider underscores as non-alpha-numeric, so underscores do not get removed form the text. On the other hand since, the tokenizer already generates a list of words, we use this list to generate a vocobulary of words in the dataset at this step it-self, making the preprocessing faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "There timing on the first review in the training set was as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) punc_filter_and_to_lower1: Wall time: ~ 3 s\n",
    "\n",
    "2) punc_filter_and_to_lower2: Wall time: ~ 8 ms\n",

    "3) punc_filter_and_to_lower3: Wall time: ~ 6 ms\n",
    "\n",
    "4) punc_filter_and_to_lower4: Wall time: ~ 6 ms (when not udating a vocabulary of words) \n",
    "\n",
    "5) 4) punc_filter_and_to_lower4: Wall time: ~ 7 ms (when also udating a vocabulary of words) \n",

It is to enjoy that he watches a show, unless he/she is a critic or a person who analyzes story. But most of us are not so and watch the shows to relax and enjoy. FULL HOUSE is an ideal show to watch after having a heavy day in the office/school. It makes you laugh and it is not just humor.<br /><br />Yes, the Tanner family is a perfect family, a perfectly hypothetical family. If any such family existed in real world, it would be a role model for us to follow. But this is a TV show, and not a real family, and there is nothing wrong in depicting a hypothetical family on television. The very fact that the show could run so long shows us that people enjoyed watching it, whatever be the comments later on.<br /><br />Another good point about the show is that any person of any age would not only enjoy watching it, but would take back a message however childish that message be. Those Jesse's talks with Michelle are extremely touching, if one doesn't think of it as childish.<br /><br />Overall I would say after watching every show of Full House, there is a contentment in your heart that is rarely present after many other shows.\">, <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=int64, numpy=1>)\n",

Intensely loyal to each other, they meet their greatest & most deadly challenge when they encounter the resurgence of a hideous cult & its demented, implacable guru. Now they must rely on the lowliest servant of the regiment, the water carrier GUNGA DIN, to save scores of the Queen's soldiers from certain massacre.<br /><br />Based more on The Three Musketeers than Kipling's classic poem, this is a wonderful adventure epic - a worthy entry in Hollywood's Golden Year of 1939. Filled with suspense & humor, while keeping the romantic interludes to the barest minimum, it grips the interest of the viewer and holds it right up to the (sentimental) conclusion.<br /><br />It is practically fruitless to discuss the performance nuances of the three stars, Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen & Douglas Fairbanks Jr., as they are really all thirds of a single organism - inseparable and, to all intents & purposes, indistinguishable. However, this diminishes nothing of the great fun in simply watching them have a glorious time.<br /><br />(It's interesting to note, parenthetically, that McLaglen boasted of a distinguished World War One military career; Fairbanks would have a sterling record in World War Two - mostly in clandestine affairs & earning himself no fewer than 4 honorary knighthoods after the conflict; while Grant reportedly worked undercover for British Intelligence, keeping an eye on Hollywood Nazi sympathizers.)<br /><br />The real acting laurels here should go to Sam Jaffe, heartbreaking in the title role. He infuses the humble man with radiant dignity & enormous courage, making the last line of Kipling's poem ring true. He is unforgettable.<br /><br />Montague Love is properly stalwart as the regimental major, whilst Eduardo Ciannelli is Evil Incarnate as the Thuggee guru. The rest of the cast, Joan Fontaine, Robert Coote, Lumsden Hare, are effective but have little to do. Movie mavens will recognize Cecil Kellaway in the tiny role of Miss Fontaine's father.<br /><br />The film picks its villains well. The demonic Thuggee cult, worshipers of the hideous, blood-soaked Kali, Hindu goddess of destruction, was the bane of Indian life for 6 centuries, ritualistically strangling up to 30,000 victims a year. In 1840 the British military, in cooperation with a number of princely states, succeeded in ultimately suppressing the religion.

The difference between last years and this years match however was the entertainment value. In reality only three people stood a chance of walking out of the Pepsi Arena in Albany, New York with the WWE Championship. Those men were current champion John Cena, Kurt Angle and Shawn Michaels. There was no way Vinnie Mac would put the belt on any of the rookies; Carlito or Chris Masters. And Kane? Kane last held the WWE Championship in June 1998, and that was only for one night. It was obvious he wasn't going to be the one either. Last years match was a thrilling affair with six of the best WWE had to offer. 2006 was a predictable and disappointing affair but still the match of the night by far.<br /><br />The only surprise of the evening came after the bell had run on the main event. Out strolled Vince McMahon himself and demanded they lift the chamber. It was then announced that Edge was cashing in his money in the bank championship match right then and there. With no time to prepare and just off the back of winning the Elimination Chamber match John Cena did not stand a chance and dropped the title after a spear to one of the most entertaining heels in WWE. This was the only entertaining piece of action that happened all night.<br /><br />The undercard, like last year, was truly atrocious. Triple H and The Big Show put on a snore fest that had me struggling to stay away. HHH picked up the win but that was never in any real doubt was it? Any pay-per-view that has both Jerry Lawler and Viscera wrestling on the same card will never have any chance of becoming a success really does it. The King pinned Helms (who books this stuff?) and Big Vis tasted defeat against the wasted Shelton Benjamin with a little help from his Mama.<br /><br />The women of the WWE also had a busy night. There was the usual Diva nonsense with a Bra and Panties Gauntlet match which was won by Ashley and the Woman's Championship was also on the line. In a match, I thought would have been left to brew till WrestleMania 22 Mickie James challenged Trish Stratus in a good match. Trish won the contest but it was evident that this is going to continue for the foreseeable future.<br /><br />The opening contest of the night pitted soon to be WWE Champion Edge against Intercontinental Champion, Ric Flair. This could have been better but it was a battered and bloody Flair that retained after a disqualification finish. Edge obviously had bigger fish to fry.<br /><br />So New Years Revolution kicked off the 2006 pay-per-view calendar in disastrous fashion. The only good thing from that is knowing that for the WWE the only way is up. They don't get much worse than this.\">, <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=int64, numpy=0>)\n",

Here, Moran is OK -- just OK -- as Dressler's shrewish friend/foe. Too bad she has sunk into nearly total oblivion.<br /><br />The plot is good hearted. Bad guys try to rob the townspeople. Dressler triumphs and all ends well.<br /><br />I do wonder about the central plot mechanism: bonds. This came out during the Depression so maybe everyone was familiar with bonds and what they can do if used well and if used wrongly. I, however, not of that era, am vaguely familiar with them.

It evocatively captures the feeling of this family and much of the country during the period just prior to and after Pearl Harbor.<br /><br />I appreciated the visual look of the film -- naturalistic and simultaneously poetic. Great work by a great D.P., David Boyd.<br /><br />Though a family film, the story never becomes maudlin or saccharin. We understand and believe the motivation that propels the young boy on his odyssey. I understand the love of the younger brother for his older brother and do not question why he sets out to do what he does. I understand that he is driven by a deep desire to be with his brother in this time of crisis.

Earth, wind, water and fire are all included in drastic and powerful sequences to pronounce a feeling of overall power to the situation.<br /><br />This really does justify the tag of thriller with a constant tension and sharp drama with the issues and beliefs once more given a full working over.<br /><br />Just like 3 years ago, there are many debates and discoveries of symbols once believed to be lost forever and Langdon is again the key character to show everyone the light in and amongst the controversy of other pressing circumstances.<br /><br />It is fair to say Dan Brown is a complex writer; he certainly likes to cram issues and dramas in amongst his action and thrilling sequences. As well as trying to discover the Illuminati, there is also the scenario of the election of a new pope, the dealings with a new scientific experiment and the power of Religion is again present. All interesting to discover and listen to, if occasionally the debates and dialogue tend to send your mind drifting but as there is so much in the novel, this was always likely.<br /><br />Ron Howard, who kept a frankly ordinary type of direction rolling in Da Vinci, returns in perhaps the worst way possible. His jerky ever moving camera styling does nothing to keep the pressure up, and we can never fully accept what is happening on screen thanks to this frankly awfully portrayed style. He is certainly no Paul Greengrass and this is by no means Bourne.<br /><br />Slick and stylized this is faster and more interesting than Da Vinci\">, <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=int64, numpy=1>)\n",

It's all pretty tacky and cheap-looking and often downright silly, pornography and unfunny wisecracks all too often replacing horror.

But you can't find a good copy of it, terrible copy full with green drops, the editing isn't syncronized, the sound do has sometimes that terrible hiss and sometimes you even can hear the camera recording. Overall it's too dark, a waist of time you should say but it isn't. It's a bit slow, the first half part of the movie it's all talking and making love to each other. It is even still weird that the girls in movies from the 60's never wear any bra's. When they enter the sleeping room it's full glory. Anyway, banned in the UK since 84 and still on the video nasties list. The reason is simple, it's gory for their time being. It really has some nasty dismemberement's and it's creepy in some way due the fact that it is filmed handycam way. So every shot the image is moving, things they do these days with the steadycam.

      "(<tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=string, numpy=b\"The first review I saw of this on IMDB says that Vince Vaughn is a much better actor than Anthony Perkins was in this role. Makes me wonder if he saw the original. It's tough to review Psycho if you don't have the perspective of how revolutionary the movie was in 1960. You have a heroine who isn't very likable and is killed not far into the movie and a villain who is creepy, but makes you feel for him. Add to that some graphic violence and you have a blue print for some of the slasher films of the 80s and 90s.<br /><br />Where does this film go wrong? Let's start with casting. Anne Heche is fine as a Vivian Crane, but as Norman Bates, Vince Vaughn is all wrong. For one thing, he looks far too young. Secondly, he has no idea how to play the roll. His nervous laugh reminds me of Ron Howard trying to play a tough guy on Happy Days. Everything he does screams I DID IT! The original movie, even to those who know everything about it, still makes you feel uneasy about the influence of mother on Norman, and turns her into a real separate character. How about the shower scene. When I finally saw the 1960 movie on a big screen, I was surprised at its power to scare the heck out of me. Bernard Herrman's score becomes incredibly shrill and loud and goes further toward scaring you than Danny Elfman's synth interpretations during the scene. This shower scene merely serves to show us Anne Heche's naked body and some nice color blood. Which brings us to the choice to film in color. Didn't work.<br /><br />There is something about remaking classic films that hardly ever seems to work. Some may see this as a noble experiment, but honestly, if Gus Van Sant had nothing to add to this film, he should have left it alone\">, <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=int64, numpy=0>)\n",

whose commitment to bringing a woman s sensibility to the screen outweighs her artistic strengths rosenstrasse which has garnered mixed and even strange reviews the new york times article was one of the most negatively aggressive reviews i ve ever read in that paper is not a perfect film it is a fine movie and a testament to a rare coalescing of successful opposition to the genocidal nazi regime by of all peoples generically powerless germans demonstrating in a berlin street co writer von trotta uses the actual rosenstrasse incident in the context of a young woman s search for information about her mother s never disclosed life as a child in the german capital during world war ii the husband of ruth weinstein jutta lampe has died and in a surprising reversion to an orthodox jewish lifestyle apparently hitherto in long abeyance ruth not only sits shivah the jews week long mourning ritual but she insists on following the strict proscriptions of her faith her apartment in new york city reflects the affluence secured by her deceased spouse s labors her american born daughter hannah maria schrader and her brother are a bit put off by mom s assumption of restrictive orthodox jewish practices but they pitch in the mother coldly rejects the presence of hannah s fiance a non jew named luis fedja van huet a domestic crisis might well erupt as ruth warns that she ll disown hannah if she doesn t give up doting handsome luis stay tuned a cousin arrives to pay her respects and also drops clues to an interested hannah about a wartime mystery about mom s childhood in berlin hannah is intrigued she queries her mom who resolutely refuses to discuss that part of her life this is very very realistic i grew up with parents who fled nazi germany just in time and i knew many children whose families in whole but usually in part escaped the holocaust those days were simply not discussed so hannah having learned that a german gentile woman saved ruth s life traipses off to berlin hoping to find the savior still breathing were she not this would have been a very short film but ruth pretending to be a historian locates 90 year old lena fischer doris schade now a widow as the happy to be interviewed but shaken up by repressed memories lena tells her story the scenes shift fairly seamlessly between present day berlin and the war time capital the young lena of 1943 katja riemann was a fine pianist married to a jewish violinist fabian fischer martin feifel with the advent of the nazi regime he was required to use israel as a middle name just as jewish women had to add sarah to their names incidentally i wish imdb had not given fabian s name on its characters list with the false israel included it simply perpetuates a name applied by nazis as a mark of classification and degradation while germany deported most of its jewish population to concentration camps those married to aryans were exempted for a time until 1943 when the regime decided to take them too most were men a minority were jewish women married to non jews the roundup is shown here in all its frightening intensity the young lena tries to locate her husband all she and many other women know is that they re confined in a building on rosenstrasse the crowd of anxious women builds up some piteously seeking help from german officers who predictably refuse aid and also verbally abuse them jew loving whore being one appellation as a subplot lena more or less adopts eight year old ruth who hid when her mother was seized remember ruth is now sitting shiva in manhattan the child ruth is fetchingly portrayed by svea lohde through increasingly angry protestations the women finally prevail the men and a handful of women are released as in the real story the nazis gave in one of the rare almost unprecedented times when the madmen acknowledged defeat in their homicidal agenda another was the termination of the euthanasia campaign to rid the reich of mental defectives and chronic invalids but that s another story von trotta builds up the tension and each woman s story is both personal and universal hannah continues to prod the aging lena who slowly one gathers begins to suspect she s not dealing with an ordinary historian but rather someone with a need to learn about the girl she rescued the child whose mother was murdered the contrasts between rosenstrasse of 1943 a set and the street today in a bustling rebuilt unified berlin provide a recurring thematic element today s berlin bears the heritage but not the scars of a monstrous past von trotta makes that point very well the main actors are uniformly impressive lena s husband while strong is also shown as totally helpless in the snare of confinement with a likely outlook of deportation which is shown to have been clearly understood by all characters including the local police and military as a one way trip to oblivion the older ruth is catalytically forced to confront demons long suppressed in her happy new york life hannah is very believable as a young woman whose father s death triggers a need to discover her family s past these things happen although the times s critic appears not to know that von trotta s hand is sure but not perfect a scene with goebbels at a soiree enjoying lena s violin playing is unnecessary and distractive the suggestion that she may have gone to bed with the propaganda minister the most fanatical top level hitler worshiper to save her husband detracts from the wondrous accomplishment of the demonstrating spouses and relatives most of the german officers come from central casting and are molded by the erich von stroheim copy and paste school of teutonic nastiness but that s understandable the rosenstrasse story has been the subject of books and articles and some claim it s a paradigm case for arguing that many more jews could have been saved had more germans protested unfortunately that argument is nonsense the german women who occupied rosenstrasse were deeply and understandably self interested most germans were located on a line somewhere between passive and virulent anti semitism that s why the rosenstrasse protest was virtually singular whether one buys or rejects the goldenhagen thesis that most germans were willing accomplices of the actual murderers it just can not be denied that pre nazi endemic anti semitism erupted into a virulent strain from 1933 on the elderly lena remarks that what was accomplished by the women was a ray of light in an evil time most of the men and women sprung from a near death trip survived the war so a ray of light it was and von trotta s movie is a beacon of illumination showing that some were saved by the courage of largely ordinary women and for every life saved an occasion for celebration exists and always will 9 10',\n",
       "       b'i read that this did not well that the story is not solid that volckman feels he has failed in some way i disagree first it is well executed volckman is doing well to not only to try a new technique but to have a focus that is worth thinking about would immortality reduce the value of life big question i can see he trying hard to build a feeling and he is not compromising this is to be applauded i am sure it was an interesting exercise to build characters in such a form i have seen artists reduce a form to bare minimum to build the intensity of a moment i identify this film with this further it is much more interesting than richard linklater s roto scoping and volckman s story has more meaning than linklater s later stories of a wasted life on drugs old news everyone knows it but no one does anything about it renaissance has more to offer something new to think about and there are many more stories out there with loads of holes in them that do far better well done volckman really nice work',\n",
       "       b'kabei our mother 2008 is a poetic and sublime beauty from japan a real weeper i had heard great reviews for the film and rented it from netflix am i glad i did in many ways this film reminded me of the old style of japanese classic film making from the 1940 s and 1950 s that i ve come to love so much such as seen in yasujiro ozu pictures the title credits even begin in the same way with the japanese letters characters in red against neutral color burlap material i immediately thought this director loves ozu the same style was used too mostly indoor sets with only a few outdoor scenes even a couple of pillow shots as roger ebert calls them the strength of the film is built on the love of the characters for one another the story follows the lives of a japanese family before and during and after world war two the mother takes care of her growing girls the best she can after the father a university professor is arrested for anti war sympathies he s never freed and only has a few brief meetings with his wife in prison before he dies of starvation and disease meanwhile a former student of the professor comes by often to help take care of the mother and two girls he begins to fall in love with the mother and is a substitute father for the two girls but war starts and he s drafted and they have to say an abrupt farewell will they ever express their love for one another will he ever return from the war there is so much heart and gentle spirit in the performance of the lead actress sayuri yoshinaga she s almost a madonna type she s so beautiful big soulful eyes and flawless skin the actor who plays the student is phenomenal as well his name is tadanobu asano what a sensitive performance there is no macho in him at all he s gentle and kind i d certainly love to see both of these two in other movies i think i ll check to see what s available for them the two little child actresses are wonderful too the film is just released on ntsc dvd for american audiences with very easy to read english subtitles i gave it a 10 out of 10 on the imdb i cried almost as much as with the japanese film classic twenty four eyes 1954 don t miss this film',\n",

temperamental star and she ends up falling and breaks her ankle like bebe daniels did in 42nd street and another performer gets the part and become a star this film like most race films keeps people watching because of the great entertainment race films always showed black entertainment as it truly was that was popular in that time era the dancing styles the music dressing styles you ll love it this movie could of been big if it was made in hollywood it would of had better scenery better filming and more money which would make any movie better but its worth watching because it is good and micheaux does good with the little he has i have to say out of all micheaux s films swing is the best the movie features singers dancers actresses and actors who were popular but forgotten today doli armena a awesome female trumpet player who can blow the horn so good that you think gabriel is blowing a horn in the sky the sexy hot female dancer consuela harris would put ann miller and gyspy rose lee to shame adding further info popular blues singer of the 20 s and 30 s cora green is the focus of the film she s mandy a good hard working woman with a no good man who takes her money and spend it on other women a nosy neighbor played by amanda randolph tells mandy what she seen and heard and mandy goes down to the club and catches her man with an attractive curvy woman by the name of eloise played hazel diaz a hot cha entertainer in the 30 s and a fight breaks out then mandy goes to harlem where she reunites with a somewhat guardian angel lena played by one of the most beautiful women in movies dorothy van engle lena provides mandy with a home a job and helps her become a star when temperamental cora smith played by hazel i guess she s playing two parts or maybe she changed her stage name tries to ruin the show with her bad behavior when cora gets drunk and breaks her leg lena convinces everyone that mandy is right for the job and lena is right and a star is born in mandy tall long lanky but handsome carman newsome is the cool aspiring producer who lena looks out for as well pretty boy larry seymour plays the no good man but after lena threatens him he might shape up there are a few highlights but the one that sticks out to me is the part where cora smith hazel diaz struts in late for rehearsal and goes off on everyone and then her man comes in and punches her in the jaw but that s not enough she almost gets into a fight with mandy again in between there s great entertainment by chorus girls tap dancers shake dancers swing music and blues singing there s even white people watching the entertainment i wonder where micheaux found them there s even a scene where there s blacks and whites sitting together at the club micheaux frequently integrated blacks and whites in his films he should be commended for such a bold move this movie was the first race film i really enjoyed and it helped introduced me to oscar micheaux this movie is one of the best of the race film genre its a behind the scenes story about the ups and downs of show business no these early race films may not be the best can t be compared with hallelujah green pastures stormy weather cabin in the sky carmen jones or any other hollywood films but their great to watch because their early signs of black film making and plus these films provide a glimpse into black life and black entertainment through a black person s eyes these films gave blacks a chance to play people from all walks of life be beautiful classy and elegant and not just be stereotypes or how whites felt blacks should be portrayed like in hollywood most of the actors and actresses of these race films weren t the best but they were the only ones that could be afforded at the time micheaux and spencer williams couldn t afford nina mae mckinney josephine baker ethel waters fredi washington paul robeson rex ingram and more of the bigger stars so micheaux and other black and white race film makers would use nightclub performers in their movies some were good some weren t great actors and actresses but i think micheaux and others knew most weren t good actors and actresses but they were used more as apart of an experiment than for true talent they just wanted their stories told and in return many black performers got to perform their true talents in the films for some true actors actresses race films were the only type of films they could get work especially if they didn t want to play hollywood stereotypes so i think you ll be able to spot the true actors actresses from the nightclub performers these race films are very historic they could have been lost forever many are lost maybe race films aren t the greatest example of cinema but even hollywood films didn t start out great in the beginning i think if the race film genre continued it would have better if your looking for great acting most race films aren t the ones but if your looking for a real example of black entertainment and how blacks should have been portrayed in films than watch race films there are some entertaining race films with a good acting cast moon over harlem body and soul paradise in harlem keep punching

       "       b'i ve read countless of posts about this game being so similar to max payne when i played it the first time i thought it was a bit weird arcade like game with a desire to rip off the max payne style not just bullet time so when i played it for a couple of hours i realized how much fun it is and how different from max payne yeah the bullet time is a bit similar but i think it fits differently to the game style this game is non stop action a mix between a shoot em up and a fight em up so much fun as a big fan of max payne i must say that the storyline of dtr is not near to the greatness of max payne the graphics are a bit average and some of the levels look the same but if you want a bit more of that bullet time you should definitely own this game',\n",

       "       b'i saw this pilot when it was first shown and i m sure countless spirit fans hate it because like batman the green hornet etc it took the character in the direction of camp but i evidently never got enough of batman because i thought it was entertaining in some of the same ways as that show there are two parts that stay with me first when denny s partner has been fatally wounded and he makes a dramatic speech about how he always stood for the law and obeying the exact letter of it then he says something like boy was i stupid which is his way of telling denny to become a vigilante instead which he does though the tv batman kind then there s the scene where he tries to seduce the villainess into letting him go by kissing her but she isn t fooled because he s too honest to kiss her convincingly this was a great example of camp that was also underplayed by both the actor and actress',\n",
       "       b'i have no idea how imdb sorts reviews but i do know that as happens often on amazon com there are a striking number of very negative reviews for this movie which repeat the same somewhat obscure talking points almost verbatim a campaign only imdb knows as for this movie it s fine it s a funny cute and very straightforward movie it s been over a decade since i worked in brooklyn lived in queens and visited relatives in the south bronx but i found nothing inauthentic or exploitative about these kids is the grandmother a bizarre character yup do the dialogue and plot acknowledge this yes thankfully they do are other movies set in the les and featuring dominican puerto rican kids possible you betcha does that make this movie a crime as some of the to my eyes astroturf comments would suggest hardly let a thousand plastic flowers bloom this is better than any episode of degrassi jr high or degrassi high scoff at the comparison but _we ve never had that_ and i m touched to the core by this movie s humility of purpose and tender spirit that said i d love to know the backstory behind all this backbiting d',\n",
       "       b'is it a coincidence that orca was made two years after jaws orca isn t exactly a jaws rip off but it is obvious that it tried to profit from jaws s success first of all orca in my opinion was a bad movie not terrible but definitely not good average at best the plot is basically a male killer whale orca after seeing its mate and its unborn calf killed by a fisherman seeks revenge i couldn t stand to watch this movie again the direction of this film is poor and when compared to jaws it looks like the director producers and writers were almost talentless as for the acting it was very average and believable however the actual characters aren t the least bit likable the effects were alright for its time and the footage of the killer whale looked pretty good the violence is confusing bloody and not recommended for more sensitive people the music is overdone and very loud drowning out the sound effects and irritating at times i hated the way they exaggerated the intelligence of the killer whale killer whales don t mate with only one mate as depicted in orca overall this movie was bad poor in my opinion because of the reasons listed above some people may appreciate this film more because of the concept of vengeance amongst animals and humans so i m not going to bash this movie and i can understand why some people may like it my rating 3 5 10 but for its concept possibly a 5 10',\n",
       "       b'this film has a very simple but somehow very bad plot the entire movie is about a girl getting sucked through a gate to another dimension then years later it gets opened again by a witch while a group of friends including the lead actor who is having trouble getting over his ex girlfriend who is one of the other campers along with her new partner another girl that s right they re lesbians and there is some nudity of course for no particular reason unfortunately demon follows the now adult girl back through also unfortunately none of this is ever explained where exactly were they where did the demon come from how did she survive as a child in a place full of evil demons who the hell trained her and made her a gladiator type outfit the acting is terrible i think but it s hard to tell because the writing is so bad maybe there was just nothing they could do with it i give it a three because the wrestler was pretty good and the effects were pretty fun even though they were very cheap i would not recommend it it wasn t quite bad enough to be funny',\n",

       "       b'i have to admit that holly was not on my watch list for the edinburgh film festival however after the artistic director of the festival specifically recommended this film to an audience of over 200 people prior to the screening of another film i decided to go to see it wow this film is dealing with the very difficult issue of child prostitution and does so without any compromise i have found myself crying a number of times during the movie and laughing at others speaking about an emotional roller coaster the lead actor thuy nguyen is a vietnamese newcomer who was only 14 at the time of filming and had to tackle this incredibly complex and difficult role she reminded me of keisha castle hughes from whale rider but the role here is much more demanding as she has to play a child prostitute chances are that she will win numerous awards the main story is about a girl who was sold to prostitution by her family and held as a sex slave in a brothel in cambodia she meets an american played by ron livingston in a strong dramatic role that we are not used to see from him who after spending some time with her decides to help her by that time however she is sold again and he is going on a search for her around cambodia the story turns and twists and the audience can never predict what will happen next the acting was strong across the board with a very interesting international cast udo kier very convincing as a sex tourist virgine ledoyen touching as a social worker and chris penn one of his last movies the asian cast was also superb although the film deals with this difficult subject matter it focuses successfully on telling a compelling powerful story it was shot in cambodia some scenes in real operating brothels which adds to the feeling that you are almost watching a documentary it seems that the dp used a lot of hand held camera and close ups and overall it made you feel like you are right there as part of the story after the screening i was listening to other members of the audience as they left and it seemed that they were all stunned this is not an easy film to watch and i salute the filmmakers for not making a hollywood film it is by far the best film i have seen in the edinburgh film festival opinion shared by my husband and a couple of other friends'],\n",
