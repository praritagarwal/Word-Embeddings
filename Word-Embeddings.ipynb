    "In this exercise you will download a dataset, split it, create a tf.data.Dataset to load it and preprocess it efficiently, then build and train a binary classification model containing an Embedding layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - a. Download the [Large Movie Review Dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/), which contains 50,000 movies reviews from the Internet Movie Database. The data is organized in two directories, train and test, each containing a pos subdirectory with 12,500 positive reviews and a neg subdirectory with 12,500 negative reviews. Each review is stored in a separate text file. There are other files and folders (including preprocessed bag-of-words), but we will ignore them in this exercise.\n",
    "  \n",
    "    \n",
    "  - b. Split the test set into a validation set (15,000) and a test set (10,000).\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - c. Use tf.data to create an efficient dataset for each set.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - d. Create a binary classification model, using a TextVectorization layer to preprocess each review. If the TextVectorization layer is not yet available (or if you like a challenge), try to create your own custom preprocessing layer: you can use the functions in the tf.strings package, for example lower() to make everything lowercase, regex_replace() to replace punctuation with spaces, and split() to split words on spaces. You should use a lookup table to output word indices, which must be prepared in the adapt() method.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - e. Add an Embedding layer and compute the mean embedding for each review, multiplied by the square root of the number of words (see Chapter 16). This rescaled mean embedding can then be passed to the rest of your model.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - f. Train the model and see what accuracy you get. Try to optimize your pipelines to make training as fast as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  - g. Use TFDS to load the same dataset more easily: tfds.load(\"imdb_reviews\")."

    "We now try three different ways of removing punctuations from a tensorflow string and compare their timings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) punc_filter_and_to_lower1: use tf.strings.unicode_decode() to convert all the characters in the string into an array of their ascii codes. We then loop through this array, skipping over the places where the entry matches the ascii code of a punctuation. Finally we call tf.strings.unicode_encode() on this array to convert the ascii codes back to characters, thereby obtaining a string with all the punctuations stripped. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) punc_filter_and_to_lower2: use tf.regex_replace() to search and replace each punctuation by empty space. Pay special attention to prepend backslash in order to be able to use meta-characters in regex_replace.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3) punc_filter_and_to_lower3: simply extract the python string using its .numpy() method. Then simple iterate through the characters of the string, skipping over the punctutations. Join the resulting list of character using .join() method. \n",
    "\n",
    "4) punc_filter_and_to_lower4: Use [tfds.features.text.Tokenizer()](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/api_docs/python/tfds/features/text/Tokenizer) by setting it's \"alphanum_only\" arg to True. This way it will only parse alpha-numeric characters in the text and to split the text at occurrances of non-alphanumeric characters. Since whitespace is a non-alpha-numeric character, the output will largely consist of a list of words in the text.  The caeat with this approach is that words with apostrophe in them such as \" don't \" will be split into two words: \"don\" and \"t\". Also, [tfds.features.text.Tokenizer()](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/api_docs/python/tfds/features/text/Tokenizer) does NOT consider underscores as non-alpha-numeric, so underscores do not get removed form the text. On the other hand since, the tokenizer already generates a list of words, we use this list to generate a vocobulary of words in the dataset at this step it-self, making the preprocessing faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "There timing on the first review in the training set was as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) punc_filter_and_to_lower1: Wall time: ~ 3 s\n",
    "\n",
    "2) punc_filter_and_to_lower2: Wall time: ~ 8 ms\n",
    "\n",
    "3) punc_filter_and_to_lower3: Wall time: ~ 6 ms\n",
    "\n",
    "4) punc_filter_and_to_lower4: Wall time: ~ 6 ms (when not udating a vocabulary of words) \n",
    "\n",
    "5) 4) punc_filter_and_to_lower4: Wall time: ~ 7 ms (when also udating a vocabulary of words) \n",

      "(<tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=string, numpy=b'I was excited when I heard they were finally making this horrific event into a movie. The whole era (1980\\'s Southern California) and subject matter (drug and porn industry) is intriguing to me. I thought this would be a sure fire hit. I was not thrilled with the choice of Kilmer as Holmes, they do not resemble each other in physical appearance or mannerisms. I guess he sells tickets? However, I was willing to overlook this and give it a fair shot. I was a bit shocked that there were only like four other people in the entire theater with me on that first day of showing. Now the whole crime and story in the film is hard to do, I will admit that. There were no witnesses to this very violent and brutal act. John Holmes was there, but he was also a pathological liar and worried about what would happen to his family (and self) if he talked to police about it. In fact, Holmes never really testified about what happened and the crime did go unsolved. So this was still really one big mystery, a mystery that this movie does nothing to cast light on. The person writing the screenplay had a whole lot of discretion and most of the principal characters are dead. However, there is no real storyline, it is fragmented claptrap. The script is light and the actors try to hard to beef up paper thin lines by overacting. The film gives no insight into Holmes or the other people involved. Kilmer\\'s character disappears for long stretches, his girlfriend is dull, the police are jokes. Even Kudrow tries hard to make a flimsy role look substantial. It is a very shallow piece and dare I say, boring. The director even tries to turn it into a love story. Which is nice, unless you know anything about what a piece of trash John Holmes really was. Perhaps a couple of viewings of Anderson\\'s \"Boogie Nights\" might have helped here. \"Boogie Nights\" was innovative and exciting in all regards. This film on the other hand was flat and without any real charm or style. Even the music is out of place, with Duran Duran being played in a scene that was supposed to have taken place in 1980. Then we have Gordon Lightfoot? Gordon Lightfoot? There could have been a great film based on this gruesome event, but I have not seen it yet. I have not seen even a decent one yet (unless you consider the Rahad Jackson scene from Boogie Nights).'>, <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=int64, numpy=0>)\n",
