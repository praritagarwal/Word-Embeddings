    "In this exercise you will download a dataset, split it, create a tf.data.Dataset to load it and preprocess it efficiently, then build and train a binary classification model containing an Embedding layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - a. Download the [Large Movie Review Dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/), which contains 50,000 movies reviews from the Internet Movie Database. The data is organized in two directories, train and test, each containing a pos subdirectory with 12,500 positive reviews and a neg subdirectory with 12,500 negative reviews. Each review is stored in a separate text file. There are other files and folders (including preprocessed bag-of-words), but we will ignore them in this exercise.\n",
    "  \n",
    "    \n",
    "  - b. Split the test set into a validation set (15,000) and a test set (10,000).\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - c. Use tf.data to create an efficient dataset for each set.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - d. Create a binary classification model, using a TextVectorization layer to preprocess each review. If the TextVectorization layer is not yet available (or if you like a challenge), try to create your own custom preprocessing layer: you can use the functions in the tf.strings package, for example lower() to make everything lowercase, regex_replace() to replace punctuation with spaces, and split() to split words on spaces. You should use a lookup table to output word indices, which must be prepared in the adapt() method.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - e. Add an Embedding layer and compute the mean embedding for each review, multiplied by the square root of the number of words (see Chapter 16). This rescaled mean embedding can then be passed to the rest of your model.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - f. Train the model and see what accuracy you get. Try to optimize your pipelines to make training as fast as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  - g. Use TFDS to load the same dataset more easily: tfds.load(\"imdb_reviews\")."

    "We now try three different ways of removing punctuations from a tensorflow string and compare their timings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) punc_filter_and_to_lower1: use tf.strings.unicode_decode() to convert all the characters in the string into an array of their ascii codes. We then loop through this array, skipping over the places where the entry matches the ascii code of a punctuation. Finally we call tf.strings.unicode_encode() on this array to convert the ascii codes back to characters, thereby obtaining a string with all the punctuations stripped. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) punc_filter_and_to_lower2: use tf.regex_replace() to search and replace each punctuation by empty space. Pay special attention to prepend backslash in order to be able to use meta-characters in regex_replace.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3) punc_filter_and_to_lower3: simply extract the python string using its .numpy() method. Then simple iterate through the characters of the string, skipping over the punctutations. Join the resulting list of character using .join() method. \n",
    "\n",
    "4) punc_filter_and_to_lower4: Use [tfds.features.text.Tokenizer()](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/api_docs/python/tfds/features/text/Tokenizer) by setting it's \"alphanum_only\" arg to True. This way it will only parse alpha-numeric characters in the text and to split the text at occurrances of non-alphanumeric characters. Since whitespace is a non-alpha-numeric character, the output will largely consist of a list of words in the text.  The caeat with this approach is that words with apostrophe in them such as \" don't \" will be split into two words: \"don\" and \"t\". Also, [tfds.features.text.Tokenizer()](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/api_docs/python/tfds/features/text/Tokenizer) does NOT consider underscores as non-alpha-numeric, so underscores do not get removed form the text. On the other hand since, the tokenizer already generates a list of words, we use this list to generate a vocobulary of words in the dataset at this step it-self, making the preprocessing faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "There timing on the first review in the training set was as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) punc_filter_and_to_lower1: Wall time: ~ 3 s\n",
    "\n",
    "2) punc_filter_and_to_lower2: Wall time: ~ 8 ms\n",

    "3) punc_filter_and_to_lower3: Wall time: ~ 6 ms\n",
    "\n",
    "4) punc_filter_and_to_lower4: Wall time: ~ 6 ms (when not udating a vocabulary of words) \n",
    "\n",
    "5) 4) punc_filter_and_to_lower4: Wall time: ~ 7 ms (when also udating a vocabulary of words) \n",

It is to enjoy that he watches a show, unless he/she is a critic or a person who analyzes story. But most of us are not so and watch the shows to relax and enjoy. FULL HOUSE is an ideal show to watch after having a heavy day in the office/school. It makes you laugh and it is not just humor.<br /><br />Yes, the Tanner family is a perfect family, a perfectly hypothetical family. If any such family existed in real world, it would be a role model for us to follow. But this is a TV show, and not a real family, and there is nothing wrong in depicting a hypothetical family on television. The very fact that the show could run so long shows us that people enjoyed watching it, whatever be the comments later on.<br /><br />Another good point about the show is that any person of any age would not only enjoy watching it, but would take back a message however childish that message be. Those Jesse's talks with Michelle are extremely touching, if one doesn't think of it as childish.<br /><br />Overall I would say after watching every show of Full House, there is a contentment in your heart that is rarely present after many other shows.\">, <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=int64, numpy=1>)\n",

Intensely loyal to each other, they meet their greatest & most deadly challenge when they encounter the resurgence of a hideous cult & its demented, implacable guru. Now they must rely on the lowliest servant of the regiment, the water carrier GUNGA DIN, to save scores of the Queen's soldiers from certain massacre.<br /><br />Based more on The Three Musketeers than Kipling's classic poem, this is a wonderful adventure epic - a worthy entry in Hollywood's Golden Year of 1939. Filled with suspense & humor, while keeping the romantic interludes to the barest minimum, it grips the interest of the viewer and holds it right up to the (sentimental) conclusion.<br /><br />It is practically fruitless to discuss the performance nuances of the three stars, Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen & Douglas Fairbanks Jr., as they are really all thirds of a single organism - inseparable and, to all intents & purposes, indistinguishable. However, this diminishes nothing of the great fun in simply watching them have a glorious time.<br /><br />(It's interesting to note, parenthetically, that McLaglen boasted of a distinguished World War One military career; Fairbanks would have a sterling record in World War Two - mostly in clandestine affairs & earning himself no fewer than 4 honorary knighthoods after the conflict; while Grant reportedly worked undercover for British Intelligence, keeping an eye on Hollywood Nazi sympathizers.)<br /><br />The real acting laurels here should go to Sam Jaffe, heartbreaking in the title role. He infuses the humble man with radiant dignity & enormous courage, making the last line of Kipling's poem ring true. He is unforgettable.<br /><br />Montague Love is properly stalwart as the regimental major, whilst Eduardo Ciannelli is Evil Incarnate as the Thuggee guru. The rest of the cast, Joan Fontaine, Robert Coote, Lumsden Hare, are effective but have little to do. Movie mavens will recognize Cecil Kellaway in the tiny role of Miss Fontaine's father.<br /><br />The film picks its villains well. The demonic Thuggee cult, worshipers of the hideous, blood-soaked Kali, Hindu goddess of destruction, was the bane of Indian life for 6 centuries, ritualistically strangling up to 30,000 victims a year. In 1840 the British military, in cooperation with a number of princely states, succeeded in ultimately suppressing the religion.

      "(<tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=string, numpy=b\"Just like last years event WWE New Years Revolution 2006 was headlined by an Elimination Chamber match. The difference between last years and this years match however was the entertainment value. In reality only three people stood a chance of walking out of the Pepsi Arena in Albany, New York with the WWE Championship. Those men were current champion John Cena, Kurt Angle and Shawn Michaels. There was no way Vinnie Mac would put the belt on any of the rookies; Carlito or Chris Masters. And Kane? Kane last held the WWE Championship in June 1998, and that was only for one night. It was obvious he wasn't going to be the one either. Last years match was a thrilling affair with six of the best WWE had to offer. 2006 was a predictable and disappointing affair but still the match of the night by far.<br /><br />The only surprise of the evening came after the bell had run on the main event. Out strolled Vince McMahon himself and demanded they lift the chamber. It was then announced that Edge was cashing in his money in the bank championship match right then and there. With no time to prepare and just off the back of winning the Elimination Chamber match John Cena did not stand a chance and dropped the title after a spear to one of the most entertaining heels in WWE. This was the only entertaining piece of action that happened all night.<br /><br />The undercard, like last year, was truly atrocious. Triple H and The Big Show put on a snore fest that had me struggling to stay away. HHH picked up the win but that was never in any real doubt was it? Any pay-per-view that has both Jerry Lawler and Viscera wrestling on the same card will never have any chance of becoming a success really does it. The King pinned Helms (who books this stuff?) and Big Vis tasted defeat against the wasted Shelton Benjamin with a little help from his Mama.<br /><br />The women of the WWE also had a busy night. There was the usual Diva nonsense with a Bra and Panties Gauntlet match which was won by Ashley and the Woman's Championship was also on the line. In a match, I thought would have been left to brew till WrestleMania 22 Mickie James challenged Trish Stratus in a good match. Trish won the contest but it was evident that this is going to continue for the foreseeable future.<br /><br />The opening contest of the night pitted soon to be WWE Champion Edge against Intercontinental Champion, Ric Flair. This could have been better but it was a battered and bloody Flair that retained after a disqualification finish. Edge obviously had bigger fish to fry.<br /><br />So New Years Revolution kicked off the 2006 pay-per-view calendar in disastrous fashion. The only good thing from that is knowing that for the WWE the only way is up. They don't get much worse than this.\">, <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=int64, numpy=0>)\n",

Here, Moran is OK -- just OK -- as Dressler's shrewish friend/foe. Too bad she has sunk into nearly total oblivion.<br /><br />The plot is good hearted. Bad guys try to rob the townspeople. Dressler triumphs and all ends well.<br /><br />I do wonder about the central plot mechanism: bonds. This came out during the Depression so maybe everyone was familiar with bonds and what they can do if used well and if used wrongly. I, however, not of that era, am vaguely familiar with them.

It evocatively captures the feeling of this family and much of the country during the period just prior to and after Pearl Harbor.<br /><br />I appreciated the visual look of the film -- naturalistic and simultaneously poetic. Great work by a great D.P., David Boyd.<br /><br />Though a family film, the story never becomes maudlin or saccharin. We understand and believe the motivation that propels the young boy on his odyssey. I understand the love of the younger brother for his older brother and do not question why he sets out to do what he does. I understand that he is driven by a deep desire to be with his brother in this time of crisis.

Earth, wind, water and fire are all included in drastic and powerful sequences to pronounce a feeling of overall power to the situation.<br /><br />This really does justify the tag of thriller with a constant tension and sharp drama with the issues and beliefs once more given a full working over.<br /><br />Just like 3 years ago, there are many debates and discoveries of symbols once believed to be lost forever and Langdon is again the key character to show everyone the light in and amongst the controversy of other pressing circumstances.<br /><br />It is fair to say Dan Brown is a complex writer; he certainly likes to cram issues and dramas in amongst his action and thrilling sequences. As well as trying to discover the Illuminati, there is also the scenario of the election of a new pope, the dealings with a new scientific experiment and the power of Religion is again present. All interesting to discover and listen to, if occasionally the debates and dialogue tend to send your mind drifting but as there is so much in the novel, this was always likely.<br /><br />Ron Howard, who kept a frankly ordinary type of direction rolling in Da Vinci, returns in perhaps the worst way possible. His jerky ever moving camera styling does nothing to keep the pressure up, and we can never fully accept what is happening on screen thanks to this frankly awfully portrayed style. He is certainly no Paul Greengrass and this is by no means Bourne.<br /><br />Slick and stylized this is faster and more interesting than Da Vinci\">, <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=int64, numpy=1>)\n",

There are some genuinely good moments such as Angela's speech about demons, and the briefly-seen demon itself is effective. But this really doesn't stand up to repeated viewing or close analysis. It's all pretty tacky and cheap-looking and often downright silly, pornography and unfunny wisecracks all too often replacing horror.

But you can't find a good copy of it, terrible copy full with green drops, the editing isn't syncronized, the sound do has sometimes that terrible hiss and sometimes you even can hear the camera recording. Overall it's too dark, a waist of time you should say but it isn't. It's a bit slow, the first half part of the movie it's all talking and making love to each other. It is even still weird that the girls in movies from the 60's never wear any bra's. When they enter the sleeping room it's full glory. Anyway, banned in the UK since 84 and still on the video nasties list. The reason is simple, it's gory for their time being. It really has some nasty dismemberement's and it's creepy in some way due the fact that it is filmed handycam way. So every shot the image is moving, things they do these days with the steadycam.

      "(<tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=string, numpy=b\"The first review I saw of this on IMDB says that Vince Vaughn is a much better actor than Anthony Perkins was in this role. Makes me wonder if he saw the original. It's tough to review Psycho if you don't have the perspective of how revolutionary the movie was in 1960. You have a heroine who isn't very likable and is killed not far into the movie and a villain who is creepy, but makes you feel for him. Add to that some graphic violence and you have a blue print for some of the slasher films of the 80s and 90s.<br /><br />Where does this film go wrong? Let's start with casting. Anne Heche is fine as a Vivian Crane, but as Norman Bates, Vince Vaughn is all wrong. For one thing, he looks far too young. Secondly, he has no idea how to play the roll. His nervous laugh reminds me of Ron Howard trying to play a tough guy on Happy Days. Everything he does screams I DID IT! The original movie, even to those who know everything about it, still makes you feel uneasy about the influence of mother on Norman, and turns her into a real separate character. How about the shower scene. When I finally saw the 1960 movie on a big screen, I was surprised at its power to scare the heck out of me. Bernard Herrman's score becomes incredibly shrill and loud and goes further toward scaring you than Danny Elfman's synth interpretations during the scene. This shower scene merely serves to show us Anne Heche's naked body and some nice color blood. Which brings us to the choice to film in color. Didn't work.<br /><br />There is something about remaking classic films that hardly ever seems to work. Some may see this as a noble experiment, but honestly, if Gus Van Sant had nothing to add to this film, he should have left it alone\">, <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=int64, numpy=0>)\n",
