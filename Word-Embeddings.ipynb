    "In this exercise you will download a dataset, split it, create a tf.data.Dataset to load it and preprocess it efficiently, then build and train a binary classification model containing an Embedding layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - a. Download the [Large Movie Review Dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/), which contains 50,000 movies reviews from the Internet Movie Database. The data is organized in two directories, train and test, each containing a pos subdirectory with 12,500 positive reviews and a neg subdirectory with 12,500 negative reviews. Each review is stored in a separate text file. There are other files and folders (including preprocessed bag-of-words), but we will ignore them in this exercise.\n",
    "  \n",
    "    \n",
    "  - b. Split the test set into a validation set (15,000) and a test set (10,000).\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - c. Use tf.data to create an efficient dataset for each set.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - d. Create a binary classification model, using a TextVectorization layer to preprocess each review. If the TextVectorization layer is not yet available (or if you like a challenge), try to create your own custom preprocessing layer: you can use the functions in the tf.strings package, for example lower() to make everything lowercase, regex_replace() to replace punctuation with spaces, and split() to split words on spaces. You should use a lookup table to output word indices, which must be prepared in the adapt() method.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - e. Add an Embedding layer and compute the mean embedding for each review, multiplied by the square root of the number of words (see Chapter 16). This rescaled mean embedding can then be passed to the rest of your model.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - f. Train the model and see what accuracy you get. Try to optimize your pipelines to make training as fast as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  - g. Use TFDS to load the same dataset more easily: tfds.load(\"imdb_reviews\")."

    "We now try three different ways of removing punctuations from a tensorflow string and compare their timings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) punc_filter_and_to_lower1: use tf.strings.unicode_decode() to convert all the characters in the string into an array of their ascii codes. We then loop through this array, skipping over the places where the entry matches the ascii code of a punctuation. Finally we call tf.strings.unicode_encode() on this array to convert the ascii codes back to characters, thereby obtaining a string with all the punctuations stripped. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) punc_filter_and_to_lower2: use tf.regex_replace() to search and replace each punctuation by empty space. Pay special attention to prepend backslash in order to be able to use meta-characters in regex_replace.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3) punc_filter_and_to_lower3: simply extract the python string using its .numpy() method. Then simple iterate through the characters of the string, skipping over the punctutations. Join the resulting list of character using .join() method. \n",
    "\n",
    "4) punc_filter_and_to_lower4: Use [tfds.features.text.Tokenizer()](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/api_docs/python/tfds/features/text/Tokenizer) by setting it's \"alphanum_only\" arg to True. This way it will only parse alpha-numeric characters in the text and to split the text at occurrances of non-alphanumeric characters. Since whitespace is a non-alpha-numeric character, the output will largely consist of a list of words in the text.  The caeat with this approach is that words with apostrophe in them such as \" don't \" will be split into two words: \"don\" and \"t\". Also, [tfds.features.text.Tokenizer()](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/api_docs/python/tfds/features/text/Tokenizer) does NOT consider underscores as non-alpha-numeric, so underscores do not get removed form the text. On the other hand since, the tokenizer already generates a list of words, we use this list to generate a vocobulary of words in the dataset at this step it-self, making the preprocessing faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "There timing on the first review in the training set was as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) punc_filter_and_to_lower1: Wall time: ~ 3 s\n",
    "\n",
    "2) punc_filter_and_to_lower2: Wall time: ~ 8 ms\n",

    "3) punc_filter_and_to_lower3: Wall time: ~ 6 ms\n",

    "4) punc_filter_and_to_lower4: Wall time: ~ 6 ms (when not udating a vocabulary of words) \n",
    "\n",
    "5) 4) punc_filter_and_to_lower4: Wall time: ~ 7 ms (when also udating a vocabulary of words) \n",

First Pachelbel's Canon brought a lump to my throat, then the sight of a Tiger Moth (which my grandfather, my father and I have all flown) produced a slight dampness around the eyes and then Crowe's name hooked me completely. I was entranced by this film, Crowe's performance (again), the subject matter (and yes, what a debt we owe), how various matters were addressed and dealt with, the flying sequences (my father flew Avro Ansons, too), the story - and, as another contributor pointed out, Crowe's recitation of High Flight. I won't spoil the film for anyone, but, separated from my wife by 4,000-odd miles, as an ex-army officer who was deployed in a couple of wars and as private pilot, I admit to crying heartily a couple of times.

The particular theme of films this night was \"Neglected 70\\'s Crime Films\" and boy was her right. \"The Gravy Train(or The Dion Brothers, as it appeared this print)\" was an absolute gem. Wonderful performances, quirky characters, smart plot, hilarious comedy, and just an all around great time. Rarely do you see a Crime film that is so entertaining and fresh. Margot Kidder in one of her earliest film appearances is extremely sexy as well. I hope some cable network gets a hold of this film and allows many more to see it.

No doubt she does, but NOT in this film. A colossal waste of time, no story, no character development, no chemistry, nada. This was not the vehicle that we all hoped this film would be, boring and a HUGE disappointment. Didn't even watch the whole film, torture. Catherine Zeta-Jones was obviously trained in how to work a kitchen, move around, present a dish but this wasn't the food network, nothing learned here and once her counterpart appeared, supposedly a romantic interest brewing, where was the chemistry. The poor slob on the second floor of her building trying all the ploys to connect and no character development there. The loss of her sister was poorly played out as who knew there was a closeness. The sister's daughter just was plopped here and there with something that was supposed to draw you in, NOT. Just a waste of movie time. The promoters certainly did their job to put this lack-luster film on all the networks tempting you with all kinds of teasers.

This has to be one of the dumbest shows ever conceived. Sure there are worse reality shows but none are as mean spirited or as dumb.<br /><br />Bam Margera has made it big, and his parents decided to piggy bank off of his fame. Bam and his parents, his uncle, his crew of idiotic friends all live together, and while Bam and his buddies are off breaking things and getting into mischief, generally his parents are at home being stupid. When Bam's parents aren't at home being lazy, they're being tortured by Bam, especially his father. To add to the humor, we are treated to his fat uncle Don Vitto who is constantly out of it, and never paying attention.<br /><br />This show really is like a toned down version of Jackass...toned down in that there aren't stunts, instead Bam and his buddies just go break stuff, and do lame stunts, and meanwhile loud music plays to make it all the more awesome. This is not funny in the least. I can't imagine a dumber show than this because there is not an ounce of intelligence found here.<br /><br />If you are a big fan of Bam Margera, and want to see one of the many follow up/cash-in sequels to the Jackass series.<br /><br />My rating: * out of ****. 30 mins.

He was well cast in this. His character was very likable, as was Kevin James\\'. <br /><br />There were several laugh out loud scenes.

There is plenty of guy humor in it for men to enjoy. I think that\\'s one of the reasons why this movie is so perfect as a date movie. It has romance AND slapstick.

The story focuses on Baman taking on three enemies: The Penguin (wonderfully played by Danny DeVito) Catwoman (the slinky Michelle Pfeiffer) and Max Shreck (the superb Christopher Walken).<br /><br />Perhaps the best entry in the series, it has it all: complex themes, complex characters and a dark tone that truly stands out. The cast is simply wonderful although the obvious stand-out is DeVito as the multi-layered Penguin. Here is a guy who is evil, pitiable, funny and perhaps most importantly, scary. The infamous scene with Shreck\\'s image consultants still sends shivers up my spine. In other words, the cast is simply a joy to watch and all turn in first rate performances.<br /><br />I do not hesitate to say that \"Batman Returns\" is my favorite of all the Batmans released (sorry, Dark Knight fans).

I do not feel the director was adequate for the film as several very bad choices were made re: shot angles, blocking, etc. If the director was trying to give it a \"realistic\" feel, they failed and lost some good performances because of it. Nearly always felt that the camera was way too static, too far from intense facial reactions -- and so many times when the action depended on the intimacy of lead characters, the dialog was slow and plodding. This easily could have been resolved by cutaways or changes of camera angle. But the impression I got was that the budget was too small and only one camera was used!
